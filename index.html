<h1>NIKA SINGLETARY INTRODUCTION</h1>
  

<p>My name is Nika Singletary and I live in Atlanta, GA. I am taking this class as a way of getting closer to my goal of being in the IT field. I have always been interested in computers and coding. My goal after graduating from Tri-C is to get a job as a Full Stack Web Developer or a Software Developer.</p>

<p>A dream of mine is to sail around the world. A goal of mine is to own at least 25 properties.</p>
